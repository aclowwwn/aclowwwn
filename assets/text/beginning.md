## The story begins in 2015. Actually, it begins in '95, but I'm not gonna go that far behind. I got my first job that year, as a web **developer**. That 2015, to be clear. And no, by web developer I don't mean spider.

## I was a CS student back then, and my first encounter with real life programming was...quite different from what I had learned until then. However, I got to work and hand-on learned JS, React, Redux and other cool stuff. You can see some of the project I worked on [here](/xp). 

## I liked it a lot, but for a **people** person like me, sitting all day in front of a computer wasn't the dream. Something was missing.
