## One of the people I met during this time is Dan. He is...awesome. He became my mentor and in 2018, Dan, Andrei (another cool guy) and I decided to go **all in** to build the project of our dreams. [**Carmel**](https://carmel.io). **Carmel is a tech education platform, created to help (at least) 1 Billion people learn the skills they need in a continuously robotized world, in order to provide for their families.** Crazy dream, right? 

## In order to prove the learning model we have at Carmel, we held an internship. Half a year, 5AM to 7AM, every morning (crazy, I know), 4 students. And this is how I became a **teacher**. And we proved our model. We're still perfecting it, of course. Feel free to check it, btw. Read the [#CarmelStory](http://files.carmel.io/whitepaper/en-v1.4.pdf) and let me know what you think.

## And this is when I finally got it. This is what technology is about. Or should be about. Serving people. Not controlling them, but enabling anyone to see his or her dreams coming true. Through technology. And I can be a part of this. That's **#goals**.
