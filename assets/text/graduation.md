## All changed in 2016, after graduation. Having more free time to invest now, opportunities arise. I started to volunteer in different organizations, met lots of amazing people, and, in the process, I became a **clowwwn**. Sorry, a **clown**. ðŸ˜€

## I love working with kids. Kids are the best. So, when I met the founder of WeCare, an NGO that sends volunteers in hospitals or orphanages to spend time with the kids there, I jumped in. There I received my first clown suit, and so **Button**ðŸ¤¡ was born. I'm still working on finding a name for it, but, for now, Button is the best I've got. Have a better idea? **Let me know.**
